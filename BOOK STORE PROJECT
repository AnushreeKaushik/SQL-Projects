-- I imported SQL files to create tables (Books, Customers, Orders) and used SQL queries to analyze.

-- 1) Retrieve all books in the "Fiction" genre:

SELECT * FROM Books 
WHERE Genre='Fiction';

-- 2) Find books published after the year 1950:
SELECT * FROM Books 
WHERE Published_year>1950;

-- 3) List all customers from the Canada:
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE country='Canada';

-- 4) Show orders placed in November 2023:

SELECT * FROM Orders 
WHERE order_date 
BETWEEN '2023-11-01' AND '2023-11-30';

-- 5) Retrieve the total stock of books available:

SELECT SUM(stock) AS Total_Stock
From Books;


-- 6) Find the details of the most expensive book:
SELECT * FROM Books 
ORDER BY Price DESC 
LIMIT 1;


-- 7) Show all customers who ordered more than 1 quantity of a book:
SELECT * FROM Orders 
WHERE quantity>1;



-- 8) Retrieve all orders where the total amount exceeds $20:
SELECT * FROM Orders 
WHERE total_amount>20;



-- 9) List all genres available in the Books table:
SELECT DISTINCT genre
 FROM Books;


-- 10) Find the book with the lowest stock:
SELECT * FROM Books 
ORDER BY stock 
LIMIT 1;


-- 11) Calculate the total revenue generated from all orders:
SELECT SUM(total_amount) As Revenue 
FROM Orders;

-- Advance Questions : 

-- 1) Retrieve the total number of books sold for each genre:

SELECT * FROM ORDERS;

SELECT b.Genre, SUM(o.Quantity) AS Total_Books_sold
FROM Orders o
JOIN Books b ON o.book_id = b.book_id
GROUP BY b.Genre;


-- 2) Find the average price of books in the "Fantasy" genre:
SELECT AVG(price) AS Average_Price
FROM Books
WHERE Genre = 'Fantasy';


-- 3) List customers who have placed at least 2 orders:
      SELECT  c.customer_ID , c.Name, count(o.Order_ID) as Total_Orders
      FROM Orders o 
      join Customers c on  c.customer_ID  = o.customer_ID
      group by c.customer_ID , c.Name
      having count(Order_ID)>=2;
      
-- 4) Find the most frequently ordered book:
	  SELECT o.BOOK_ID ,  b.Title, count(o.Order_ID) AS Total_Books_Ordered
      from  Orders o
      join books b  on  b.Book_ID =  o.Book_ID
      group by o.Book_ID , b.Title
      order by Total_Books_Ordered desc
      Limit 1;


-- 5) Show the top 3 most expensive books of 'Fantasy' Genre :
        SELECT * FROM Books
        where Genre = 'Fantasy'
        order by  Price desc
        limit 3;

-- 6) Retrieve the total quantity of books sold by each author:
           SELECT b.Author, sum(o.Quantity) As Total_Quantity 
           from Books b 
           join Orders o on b.Book_ID = o.Book_ID 
           group by b.Author
           order by Total_Quantity desc;
           
-- 7) List the cities where customers who spent over $30 are located:
      Select distinct c.city , o.Total_Amount
      from Orders o
      join Customers c  on c.customer_ID = o.customer_ID
      where  o.Total_Amount >30;



-- 8) Find the customer who spent the most on orders:
       select c.customer_ID , c.Name , sum(o.Total_Amount) as Total_Spent
       from Customers c 
       join Orders o  on c.customer_ID = o.customer_ID
       group by  c.customer_ID , c.Name
       order by  Total_Spent desc;



-- 9) Calculate the stock remaining after fulfilling all orders:
       select b.Book_ID , b.Stock as Initial_Stock,
       coalesce(sum(o.Quantity),0) as Total_ordered,
       b.Stock -   coalesce(sum(o.Quantity),0)  as Remaining_stock
       from Books b
       left join Orders o on b.Book_ID = o.Book_ID 
       group by b.Book_ID , b.Stock ;
