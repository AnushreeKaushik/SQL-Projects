 -------------------- Hospital Dataset Analysis----------------------

- Performed end-to-end analysis on a hospital dataset containing 100+ records across departments, locations and medical details.
- Applied SQL functions such as SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DATEDIFF, LIMIT to derive business insights.
- Identified top departments by patient volume, highest medical expenditure hospital, and longest hospital stay cases.
- Generated city-wise patient reports and department-wise average length of stay for healthcare decision-making.
- Designed optimized analytical queries useful for hospital performance monitoring and reporting.

1. Total Number of Patients.

   order by `Medical Expenses` desc
    limit 1;

 avg(datediff(`Discharge Date`, `Admission Date`)) AS Avg_Days_Stayed 
from h_d
group by  `Department`;

SELECT `Department`,SUM(`Patients Count`) AS Total_Patients
FROM h_d
GROUP BY `Department`
ORDER BY Total_Patients ASC;
